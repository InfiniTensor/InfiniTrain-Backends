InfiniTrain Backends provides out-of-tree accelerator backends for
[InfiniTrain](https://github.com/InfiniTensor/InfiniTrain). It keeps
vendor-specific SDK integration, runtime support, collective communication,
and kernels outside the framework core while implementing InfiniTrain's
`PrivateUse1` backend interfaces.

Each provider is isolated under `backends/<provider>` and normally consumes the
InfiniTrain submodule pinned to `v0.7.0`. One build tree selects one provider, and a
process may register at most one provider for `DeviceType::kPrivateUse1`.

## Supported Backends

| Backend | Runtime | Collectives | Model examples |
| ------- | ------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| [MACA](backends/maca/README.md) | MACA | MCCL (optional) | GPT-2, LLaMA 3, Mixtral |

The model sources normally come from the pinned InfiniTrain submodule. Each
backend supplies the runtime, kernels, collective implementation, and build
integration needed to run its supported examples on the corresponding
accelerator. See the linked backend guides for setup and usage.

## Common Requirements

- **Linux**
- **CMake**: 3.28 or newer
- **Git** with submodule support
- A **C++20** compiler and vendor SDK compatible with the selected backend

Additional dependencies and SDK setup are documented in each backend's guide.

## Build Options

These options apply across backends. Provider-specific options are documented
in the corresponding backend guide.

| Option | Default | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| `INFINITRAIN_BACKEND` | Required | Provider selected from `backends/<provider>` |
| `INFINITRAIN_SOURCE_DIR` | `third_party/InfiniTrain` | InfiniTrain source tree, normally the pinned submodule |
| `INFINITRAIN_BACKENDS_BUILD_EXAMPLES` | `ON` for a top-level build | Build provider-enabled InfiniTrain examples |
| `BUILD_TEST` | `OFF` | Build InfiniTrain's unit tests and variants for the selected provider |

Use a separate build directory for each provider so compiler and SDK cache
entries do not leak between them. Top-level builds enable backend examples by
default.

For development against another InfiniTrain checkout, add
`-DINFINITRAIN_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/InfiniTrain` to the configure command. The
selected checkout must implement the PrivateUse1 extension API expected by
the backend.

PrivateUse1 providers require `USE_CUDA=OFF`; configuration fails rather than
silently overriding an explicit `USE_CUDA=ON`. Unit tests for the selected
provider use the PrivateUse1 device type and `PRIVATEUSE1/*` GTest prefix,
independent of the provider's name.

```

The root build selects and includes
`backends/<provider>/cmake/pre_project.cmake` before its first `project()` call.
This lets each provider select its compiler and prepare SDK-specific dependency
probes without adding vendor branches to the root `CMakeLists.txt`.

When adding this repository as a third-party library with `add_subdirectory()`,
select the compiler required by the provider in the parent project before
enabling the C++ language. After setting up the vendor SDK environment, use
the following order in the parent's `CMakeLists.txt`, replacing the compiler
path and provider name:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.28)

set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "/path/to/vendor/compiler" CACHE FILEPATH "")
set(INFINITRAIN_BACKEND "<provider>" CACHE STRING "")

project(MyTrainingApp LANGUAGES CXX)
add_subdirectory(third_party/InfiniTrain-Backends)
```

CMake cannot replace a compiler after a language has been enabled.
